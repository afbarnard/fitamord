"""
Framework for the intelligent transformation and modeling of
relational data

Fitamord simplifies preparing data for machine learning, statistical
modeling, and other forms of analysis.  It supports cleaning and
translating data, transforming relational data into feature vectors, and
flexibly defining labels and study designs.  Fitamord was originally
conceived and developed for conducting comparative observational studies
of electronic medical records data using machine learning, but hopefully
you will find it generally useful for modeling with relational data.
